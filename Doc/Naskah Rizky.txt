if we have finished assembling the amplifier, the next step is testing

the first step is to prepare the power supply
the power supply used is symmetrical type, it has 3 outputs. positive, negative and ground
measure the voltage using the avometer.
if positive and ground measure 12 volts, gound and negative must be 12 volts as well, 
or the difference is not too far

calculate the output power
the formula is volts times amperes
if we have a power supply with a voltage of 12 volts 3 amps
so the power produced is 150w
if we increase the voltage and current, of course we also have to add the final transistor as well

measure the output voltage
before that, we must turn the pot volume to minimum. counterclockwise
measure the output voltage using the avometer, 10 vdc scale
if the measured dc voltage comes out. then something is wrong with the amplifier
if dc voltage is not measured. the amplifier is ready and safe when connected to a loudspeaker
